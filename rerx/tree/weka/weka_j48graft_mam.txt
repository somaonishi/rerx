Weka exception: No training file and no object input file given.

General options:

-h or -help
        Output help information.
-synopsis or -info
        Output synopsis for classifier (use in conjunction  with -h)
-t <name of training file>
        Sets training file.
-T <name of test file>
        Sets test file. If missing, a cross-validation will be performed
        on the training data.
-c <class index>
        Sets index of class attribute (default: last).
-x <number of folds>
        Sets number of folds for cross-validation (default: 10).
-no-cv
        Do not perform any cross validation.
-split-percentage <percentage>
        Sets the percentage for the train/test set split, e.g., 66.
-preserve-order
        Preserves the order in the percentage split.
-s <random number seed>
        Sets random number seed for cross-validation or percentage split
        (default: 1).
-m <name of file with cost matrix>
        Sets file with cost matrix.
-l <name of input file>
        Sets model input file. In case the filename ends with '.xml',
        a PMML file is loaded or, if that fails, options are loaded
        from the XML file.
-d <name of output file>
        Sets model output file. In case the filename ends with '.xml',
        only the options are saved to the XML file, not the model.
-v
        Outputs no statistics for training data.
-o
        Outputs statistics only, not the classifier.
-i
        Outputs detailed information-retrieval statistics for each class.
-k
        Outputs information-theoretic statistics.
-p <attribute range>
        Only outputs predictions for test instances (or the train
        instances if no test instances provided and -no-cv is used),
        along with attributes (0 for none).
-distribution
        Outputs the distribution instead of only the prediction
        in conjunction with the '-p' option (only nominal classes).
-r
        Only outputs cumulative margin distribution.
-z <class name>
        Only outputs the source representation of the classifier,
        giving it the supplied name.
-g
        Only outputs the graph representation of the classifier.
-xml filename | xml-string
        Retrieves the options from the XML-data instead of the command line.
-threshold-file <file>
        The file to save the threshold data to.
        The format is determined by the extensions, e.g., '.arff' for ARFF
        format or '.csv' for CSV.
-threshold-label <label>
        The class label to determine the threshold data for
        (default is the first label)

Options specific to weka.classifiers.trees.J48graft:

-U
        Use unpruned tree.
-C <pruning confidence>
        Set confidence threshold for pruning.
        (default 0.25)
-M <minimum number of instances>
        Set minimum number of instances per leaf.
        (default 2)
-B
        Use binary splits only.
-S
        Don't perform subtree raising.
-L
        Do not clean up after the tree has been built.
-A
        Laplace smoothing for predicted probabilities.  (note: this option only affects initial tree; grafting process always uses laplace).
-E
        Relabel when grafting.
